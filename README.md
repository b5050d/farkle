So the challenge here is to train AI to be able to play farkle

Generally the AI likes to take in continuous variables that are constant.

What could the decision space be like?

Is there a simpler farkle that I can create that will work to prove out the concept?

3 dice scoring:
- triples same as normal
- 1's same as normal
- 5's same as normal 


Action space
- Add dice to score
- Score and Pass
- Score and Roll again




Alright what about a standard game of farkle?
So you roll six dice and you can score 3x of them
